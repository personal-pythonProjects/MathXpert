# MathXpert

**MathXpert** is a modular and interactive Python calculator designed to handle a wide range of mathematical operations, from basic arithmetic to advanced trigonometry and more.

## Skills Demonstrated

### Core Python Concepts:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
  - **Encapsulation**: Operations are encapsulated into modular classes like `BasicArithmetic`, `ExponentialLogarithmic`, and others.
  - **Inheritance**: `OperationHandler` inherits methods and properties from multiple classes, enabling reuse and extensibility.
  - **Abstraction**: Logical grouping of operations (e.g., `basic_operations`, `exponential_operations`) hides implementation details and provides a simplified interface.
- **Modular Design**: Organized with separate classes for arithmetic, exponential, trigonometric, and other operations.
- **Functions**: Custom methods for operations like `add()`, `power()`, and `factorial()`.
- **Conditionals**: Validating user input and error handling (e.g., division by zero).
- **Loops**: Continuous operations for basic arithmetic.
- **Dictionaries**: Mapping operators to their respective methods.
- **Input/Output**: Interactive prompts and dynamic results.

## Example Output

```
Available operations:
Basic Arithmetic:
+  -  *  /
Exponential and Logarithmic:
**  exp  ln  log10
Power and Root:
square  cube  sqrt  cbrt
Trigonometric Functions:
sin  cos  tan  sinh  cosh  tanh
Factorial:
fact
Random:
rand

Choose an operation: +
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the next number: 5

10 + 5 = 15
Continue with this operation? (y/n): y
Enter the next number: 3

15 + 3 = 18
Continue with this operation? (y/n): n
```
